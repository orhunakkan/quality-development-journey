# A Brief Introduction to Java (Java 21)

## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language. In this introduction, we set the stage for understanding what Java is and what we can do with it.

### Programming Language

A programming language is a tool we use to write instructions that a computer can execute. Java programs compile into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing the same program to work on many systems.

### High-Level Language

Java is a high-level language, meaning we do not need to worry about lower-level details like memory manipulation. The JVM handles memory management, garbage collection, and optimizations, making Java easier to learn and safer to use.

### Object-Oriented

Java is primarily object‑oriented. Everything revolves around classes and objects, and most data structures or components are built using this model. Understanding classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation is essential for mastering Java.

### Multi-Paradigm

While Java is strongly object‑oriented, it also supports other paradigms such as functional-style programming through lambda expressions and the Stream API introduced in modern versions. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most effective style for their applications.

## Role of Java in Software Development

Java is one of the most widely used technologies in software development. It enables the development of desktop applications, backend systems, enterprise-level services, Android applications, cloud systems, and more.

Java, combined with tools, frameworks, and libraries, powers servers, APIs, distributed systems, and large‑scale business applications used worldwide.

### Real Example: Enterprise Web Applications

Many enterprise systems use Java on the server to receive requests, process data, interact with databases, and send responses back to clients. Java can manage complex workflows, background tasks, message queues, and large datasets. It is optimized for reliability and high performance, making it ideal for enterprise development.

## Recap and Further Possibilities

Java enables the creation of powerful applications across many platforms. With Java 21, developers gain access to modern features, performance improvements, and long‑term support.

Frameworks built on Java (e.g., Spring, Jakarta EE) help developers build large, scalable applications efficiently, and all of these rely on solid core Java knowledge.

Mastering Java fundamentals is essential before working with these advanced technologies.

## Java Beyond the Server

Java is not limited to backend systems. It runs on desktops, embedded devices, cloud environments, and Android systems. Thanks to the JVM, Java can be used anywhere the runtime is available.

### Java for Desktop and Mobile

Developers can build desktop interfaces using JavaFX or Swing. For mobile development, Java is used heavily in the Android ecosystem, where it powers apps, services, and mobile logic.

## Java Releases and Versions

Java uses a structured release cycle managed by Oracle and the OpenJDK community. Java 21 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, meaning it receives years of updates and is designed for production environments.

Older versions of Java introduced major features (e.g., generics, lambdas, records, switch improvements), and Java 21 continues with enhancements such as virtual threads, pattern matching, and performance upgrades.

This course content aligns with Java 21 features wherever applicable. If older Java versions differ in behavior or capabilities, those differences will be noted.
